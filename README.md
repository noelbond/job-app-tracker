# job-app-tracker

This application will track the user's job applications and provide data for analysis.

The home page displays a chart that tracks:
  - The number of applications submitted
  - The number of responses from employers
  - The number of rejections from the responses
  - The number of interviews requested
The default time frame is weekly but it can be toggled to display monthly or even YTD.

The navigation on the bottom will take the user to:
  - Bookmarked job listings
  - Replies from employers
  - Applications that haven't received a response
  - A data analysis tool
